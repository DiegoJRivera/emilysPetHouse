This project was developed as an assessment for a subject of web design.

The idea was cover topics as hyperlinks to each page to other pages on the site, include some intra-page link (jump link) and a link to an external site on the Internet (opening in a new tab/window) and an e-mail link. Use CSS (inline, embedded and external). At least one table using headers, footers, col span and row spans, formatted appropriately using CSS. One form that at least includes:
a dropdown list, checkboxes, text boxes, radio buttons, e-mail, reset and submit buttons, use of JavaScript for some validations in the contact page and
use of multimedia.

In the developed of this project was considered cover the responsive feature, for time issues was developed only for the menu.

Attached there is a folder called "design" that contains two reports. One contains a description of the requirements and scope necessary for the development of the website and the other the storyboard, navigation design, file structure and style guide. This last one has some variations in the designs presented, so there will be some inconsistencies compared to the final version available in this repository since some details were modified that were not updated in the report.
